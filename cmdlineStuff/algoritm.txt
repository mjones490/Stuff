parse() gets the list of parameter data from user.
It allocates the working structure, sets a pointer in the structure 
to the parameter data, initializes a linked list, and fills the list 
with all argv argcs passed to it.  It sets current in the structure to the
first list item.  Then calls scan_params.

scan_params() walks the list:  
    If current starts with '-':
        If second char of current is '-':
            Split the param by = if possible, and send both sides, or
            side one and NULL, allong with working structure, to 
            param_set().
        Else:
            Loop over each char in param, sending char (as string), NULL
            (in place of value), and working structure to param_set().
        Call remove_param() to remove current from list.
    Else:
        Set current to current->next, skipping this param.

param_set() walks the parameter data looking for a matching name:
    If a match is found:
        If match is a bool (like -v):
            Set the param_value to !default.  Return.
        Else:
            param_set() needs a value.  If value is NULL:
                Sets the param value to current->next.
                Call remove_param() to remove current->next from the list.
            Else:
                Use value as param_value.
        
remove_param() saves the next pointer of the param to be removed, copies
the p
