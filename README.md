## Stuff

**Stuff** is a repository of routines that I've written over the
years.  These are routines that I've found the need for across
various projects, such as *cmdLineStuff* and *configStuff*, and
things I've written because I thought they'd be nice or convenient
to have, but never really had a use for after they were written,
like *cacheStuff* and *mathStuff*.  Or even stuff I've started to
work on and never finished, like *hashStuff*.

Here is a quick summary of the routines:

* **cacheStuff** - Routines for caching objects.
* **calcStuff** - Routines to read strings of mathmatical expressions
and output the computed answer.
* **cmdlineStuff** - Routines to parse parameters passed in from the 
command line.
* **configStuff** - Routines to read and parse configuration files.
* **hashStuff** - Routines to generate FNV-1A of a given string.
